UPGRADING

In general:

  (1) Pull in the latest code from git.

  (2) Replace your application's code with the new code.
      You shouldn't lose anything here unless you modified the application files; all your data are stored in the database.

  Your site-specific config files are distributed with a .dist on their filenames, meaning your existing files won't be overwritten.
  (3) You should compare:
        /system/application/config/config.php
		/system/application/config/database.php
		/system/application/config/stikked.php
		/.htaccess
	  with the new .dist versions to see if any new options have been added which you might like (or need) to change.

To upgrade from versions before and including fc8ddef7 on 2010-02-23, you need to perform the following:
  (1) Pull in the latest code as described above.

  (2) Run the following MySQL query in your Stuck database:
        ALTER TABLE `ci_sessions` ADD `user_data` text character set utf8 NOT NULL;
