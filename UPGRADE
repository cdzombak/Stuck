UPGRADING

To upgrade from versions before and including fc8ddef7 on 2010-02-23, you need to perform the following:

(1) Pull in the latest code from git.
    Replace your application's code with the new stuff, taking care not to overwrite your configuration files or .htaccess.
    You shouldn't lose anything here unless you modified the application files; all your data are stored in the database.

(2) Run the following MySQL query in your Stuck database:
      ALTER TABLE `ci_sessions` ADD `user_data` text character set utf8 NOT NULL;

This document will be updated later to be much more detailed.
