INSTALL

For upgrade instructions, see the UPGRADE file provided with this distribution.

Installing Stuck right now isn't exactly trivial, but it's manageable if you have a little experience in this sort of thing.

(0) Check system requirements:
    (0.1) PHP 5+
	(0.2) MySQL
	(0.3) Apache

(1) Download the latest version from http://github.com/cdzombak/stuck
	
(2) Create a database and user for Stuck using phpMyAdmin, the MySQL Administration CLI, or another MySQL interface.

(3) Import the database structure. You can use this command:
	  mysql -u username -p databasename < mysql.sql
	or you can copy/paste the mysql.sql file into phpMyAdmin or your MySQL GUI of choice.

(4) Configure Stikked
	(4.1) Open /system/application/config/config.php - edit the base_url value.
	(4.2) Open /system/application/config/database.php - fill in the relevant information for your database.

    This includes the name of your site, which is displayed at the top of each page.
