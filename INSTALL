(0) Check system requirements:
    (0.1) PHP 5+
	(0.2) MySQL or PostgreSQL
	(0.3) Apache

(1) Download the latest version from http://github.com/cdzombak/stuck
	
(2) Create a database and user for Stuck 
	(2.1) For MySQL using phpMyAdmin, the MySQL Administration CLI, or another MySQL interface.
	(2.2) For PostgreSQL using phpPgAdmin, the PostgreSQL cli tools or another PostgreSQL interface (pgAdminIII)
		(2.2.1) Using CLI :
			# Create a specific user for db
			createuser stuck
			# Create the stuck db owned by stuck user
			createdb -O stuck stuck
			# Verify your pg_hba.conf file for Stuck database to be accessed by stuck user from 
			# stuck web server ip address.

(3) Import the database structure. You can use this command:
	(3.1) For MySQL
	  mysql -u username -p databasename < mysql.sql
	or you can copy/paste the mysql.sql file into phpMyAdmin or your MySQL GUI of choice.
	(3.2) For PostgreSQL

	        Fill in the relevant information for your database.
	        Save it, **removing the .dist from the filename**.

	(6.1) Set the key for cron in /system/application/config/stikked.php.
	(6.2) Open a shell and run crontab -e and enter:
